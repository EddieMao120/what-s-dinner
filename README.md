# what-s-dinner
A small web application to help you decide what to cook for dinner based on your usual recipes and the ingredients you have on hand.

**Getting Started**: A quick guide to run the app locally.

- **Prerequisites**: Node.js (LTS) and npm or yarn installed.
- **Clone**: `git clone <repo-url>`
- **Install**: `npm install` or `yarn`
- **Run (development)**: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
- **Build**: `npm run build` or `yarn build`
- **Start**: `npm start` or `yarn start`

**Features**

- Save and manage your usual recipes.
- Input available ingredients to get recipe suggestions.
- Filter by time, dietary preferences, and difficulty.

**Usage**

1. Add your common recipes with ingredients and steps.
2. Mark which ingredients you currently have.
3. Let the app suggest recipes you can make now, or ones that need only a few extra items.

**Development notes**

- This repo is intended to host the web app frontend (and optionally backend) — adapt tooling as needed.
- If you add a backend, include setup instructions in a subfolder `backend/README.md`.
